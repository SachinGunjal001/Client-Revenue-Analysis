GitHub Project Description: Professional Business Intelligence Reports

This project showcases the comprehensive development of professional business intelligence reports, starting from raw data preparation to crafting interactive dashboards. The project demonstrates the transformation of unstructured data into visually compelling and insightful dashboards using advanced data analysis and visualization techniques. By building a relational data model and employing cutting-edge tools like Power Query and DAX, this project mimics the practices of professional data analysts and data scientists, integrating advanced features like artificial intelligence to create powerful, user-friendly BI solutions.

Data Preparation & Transformation
The first stage of the project focuses on extracting, cleaning, transforming, and loading data using Power Query. This involves creating automated workflows to streamline the data preparation process. The project utilizes a wide range of tools, including data connectors, storage modes, and query editing features, to ensure data quality and usability. Advanced techniques such as merging and appending queries, pivoting and unpivoting data, and adding rolling calendars are employed to create a robust foundation for analysis. Additional steps like building index and conditional columns and importing data from Excel models and web sources highlight the versatility of the data preparation process.

Relational Data Modeling
The next stage involves creating a well-structured relational data model using industry best practices. Concepts such as database normalization, star and snowflake schemas, and relationship cardinality are explored and implemented. Fact and dimension tables are built with primary and foreign keys, ensuring a seamless flow of data across the model. The project emphasizes the importance of maintaining filter context and flow through bi-directional filters and active/inactive relationships. By using a clean and efficient model layout, this stage ensures that the data is organized for intuitive analysis and visualization.

Advanced DAX Calculations
Stage three focuses on incorporating calculated fields using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). The project demonstrates the creation of calculated columns and measures, exploring the difference between implicit, explicit, and quick measures. Advanced DAX functions like CALCULATE, FILTER, and ALL are used alongside iterators and time intelligence patterns to perform complex calculations. By employing conditional, logical, text, and date functions, the project highlights the flexibility and power of DAX for creating customized insights. This stage ensures that the data is not only accurate but also actionable for decision-making.

Interactive Dashboards & Visualizations
The final stage of the project brings data to life through interactive reports and dashboards. Data visualization best practices are applied to design user-friendly layouts, integrating various chart types such as line charts, KPIs, and trend lines. Features like conditional formatting, drill-through capabilities, and custom tooltips are added to enhance the user experience. The project also incorporates advanced interactivity elements, including slicer panels, bookmarks, and report navigation, making the dashboards dynamic and engaging. Publishing to Power BI Service and optimizing layouts for mobile devices ensures accessibility and usability across platforms.

This GitHub project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece for demonstrating expertise in business intelligence, data analysis, and visualization. It is a testament to the ability to transform raw data into impactful reports that drive data-driven decision-making in real-world scenarios.
